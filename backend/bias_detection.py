   """Not everyone seething about the ongoing abuses by local potentates is going to file a lawsuit but everyone can contribute to a shift in the national mood Last week Barstool Sports founder Dave Portnoy released a threemintute video in which he vigorously ranted against the ongoing lockdowns Portnoys basic point was that the goalposts have shifted from flatten the curve to find a cure He pointed out in blunt and colorful language that economic suicide in pursuit of the latter goal is insanity His video went viral Portnoy is not a political figure His anger over the economic crisis and sense that having done our best to slow the spread we have the right to take a risk to survive resonates with a lot of normal people One of Portnoys repeated questions throughout the video was When did this happen When did we go from flattening the curve to tanking our economy our livelihoods and our futures Language warning in the video below Last night on Tucker Carlson Andrew Napolitano offered a related reflection when he described a free state as one where the laws are written to uphold personal liberties while the definition of a police state is one where the laws are written legitimately or not to uphold what the government wants He went on to note that there has been a transition in America that has not been gradual In a period of six weeks we have gone from a free state to a police state Alarming as it is Napolitano is right While COVID19 is an obviously serious and frightening virus our leaders and many fellow Americans seem oblivious to the destruction we are selfinflicting on our economy and on millions of American lives The bureaucrats and local wouldbe dictators concocting their various plans to protect us all from each other have to be relieved of their power or the police state will be permanent So how did we get here and how do we reclaim our liberty and the right to take risks to survive We got here because as a nation we agreed to the lockdowns in the first place In late March and early April as the virus was spreading in densely populated American cities and horror stories were pouring out of Lombardy Italy the mood among Americans shifted Lockdowns started in coastal states where the threat felt most immediate and swept the nation shortly thereafter The lockdowns happened because the national mood favored the lockdowns Politicians knew they could call on their emergency powers and impose the restrictions because they would not meet resistance Collectively we consented Do not underestimate the power of a national mood Wars have been won and lost based not on the military might of a nation so much as the will of its people to either prevail or to fold Nowhere is the spirit of a people more a force to be reckoned with than in America where freedom and individual autonomy are part of our DNA This invisible force is a very real influence in politics and many constitutional abuses have never been attempted over the years not because they were unconstitutional but because politicians and leaders understood the actions would not be tolerated In some sense we are free because we choose to be free We did consent to the lockdowns and now are suffering under the insanity that has flowed from them economic suicide and petty local laws that serve no purpose other than to nanny us into submission So how do we muscle out of our bind How do we return from the police state we have become to the land of liberty that we enjoyed a mere three months ago One answer is certainly that we must enforce our constitutional rights by challenging the myriad overreaches in court That is a critically important effort and just the type of pushback I have applauded for many weeks now But in tandem to that effort and really prior to it we have to shift the mood again Not everyone seething about the ongoing abuses by local potentates is going to file a lawsuit but everyone can contribute to a shift in the national mood When people honestly express to others their opposition to continued lockdowns the sentiment spreads and the mood strengthens Portnoys video went viral not just because he is a popular guy it went viral because it gave voice to people who werent sure their gut reactions were acceptable and to people who felt encouraged by seeing someone with whom they identified step up and voice opposition We all need to step up and speak out Everyone has a zone of influence large or small and when you speak you add to a critical growing momentum We lose freedom ultimately because we let bad people take it from us Freedom is not taken by force only it is often taken slowly and quietly with our foolish consent that is given by silence America was not founded to be a police or nanny state It flourished because it was the land of the free and the home of the brave It grew to greatness because people were willing to take risks to survive and succeed The will of the American people

   """The manmade Amazon fires are for clearing the land of its forests and indigenous people The benefits are for Jair Bolsonaros cronies while producing a climate disaster for the world The Amazon fires in Brazil have become worldwide news Explaining the fires recently Douglas Morton chief of the Biospheric Sciences Laboratory at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center said that August 2019 stands out as a month with a far higher number of fires than any preceding year since 2010 This is similar to what Brazils National Institute for Space Research INPE had reported earlier The head of INPE Ricardo Galvao was fired on August 2 this year after INPE came out with figures based on satellite imagery that showed that deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon had increased by 40 percent in two months over a similar period last year That it is largely manmade can be seen from looking at where the fires have started in Brazil mostly along the major highways and spreading into the forest Clearly it is an attempt to clear the forests for economic exploitationlogging cattle ranching commercial farming and miningthat lies at the heart of President Bolsonaros policies Speaking to reporters in the last week of August Bolsonaro said It is too much land for so few Indians While he has declared a temporary moratorium on landclearing due to the fires the thrust of his policies is still to dismantle all obstacles to handing over the Amazon to big corporate and landed interests in Brazil Amazon forests are the worlds biggest store of carbon as well as its largest global sink If it goes up in smoke it will produce climate change on a scale not seen before And this change could soon become irreversible as once a forest starts dying after a point it becomes almost impossible to stop its downward plunge Apart from acting to fix atmospheric carbon Amazon forests also help in the hydrological cycle that produces rainfall The loss of forest cover in the Amazon would affect not only the worlds climate but also the local climate in Brazil and neighboring countries leading to less rainfall and adversely affecting its agriculture While Brazil has taken the lead in a direct attack on the Amazon with Bolsonaro adding a racial element to his attack on indigenous people the pressure to open the Amazonian forests to agriculture logging and mining is not just limited to Brazil Obviously why should other countries which have finished their forests argue that countries with forests keep them permanently for global benefit Who pays and who gains is very much a part of the climate change negotiations the Paris Accord from which Trump and the United States have walked out This pitchwho pays and who gainscould indeed be a nationalist pitch for Brazil But this is not Bolsonaros argument For him the only issue is that fires lit for clearing the Amazon should not burn without control he must be shedding tears about all those logs that could have been sold for money going up in smoke He is asking President Trump a fellow climate change disbeliever and another white nationalist for help with dousing the fires He has no sympathy for Brazils indigenous people Indians he calls them bemoaning the failure of the Brazilian cavalry in clearing its indigenous people unlike the US cavalry which was so much more efficient in its extermination of the Indians Before we address the complex issue of climate justice indigenous rights and economic development we need to address one misunderstanding on the role of Amazon forests Amazon forests do not produce 20 percent of the oxygen the world needs as is commonly said It is the largest producer of oxygen on land producing about 69 percent of the total oxygen that is produced globally including from the oceans Still we cannot talk of producing oxygen without also asking how much of it the Amazon consumes So we must see the net oxygen that the Amazon produces meaning subtract the oxygen consumed by it from what it produces Once we do that we find that the Amazons net output of oxygen is near zero as it is also the largest consumer of oxygen The Amazons value is in fixing atmospheric carbon and its loss will mean the release of stored carbon into the atmosphere with devastating consequences Is it possible to use the forest lands economically such that we do not have deforestation with both local and global consequences The argument is yes this can be done using scientific methods and technology such that we can get shortterm developmental benefits as well as meet longterm goals This would be different from the colonial models promoting monocultures and claiming forests on behalf of the Crown but would mean involving the forest communities in protecting forests It would mean culling forests but within limits of its regeneration and using a mix of trees that are natural to the Amazonian environment It would mean if mines and other projects are allowed in them to minimize their impact and leave large areas as untouched natural reserves Of course this would require a policy for indigenous people that respects their identity while allowing them to choose how they integrate themselves not as living museum pieces but as communities living in harmony with nature and the rest of Brazilian society These are complex issues and there is no one answer to these questions Their answer would mean a democracy that allows for dialogue and a way to reconcile the goals of development and maintains peoples identities and cultural diversities Instead of taking this complex democratic path the logic of capital is quite simple It prioritizes the interest of the capitalistsnot capital but capitalistsover other sections of the people For the capitalist there is a simple way of looking at any issue what return can I get if I can get the state to follow a certain policy Giving away of land forests and mineral resources to capitalists by the state is what Marx called primaryor primitiveaccumulation In the language of the commons it is enclosure of the commons and in this case the Amazon forests are the commons If Bolsonaro can hand over forest landsits trees its minerals and their use after clearing forests for cattleranching or soybeansfarmingto his capitalist cronies they make big bucks This is the crux of Bolsonaros policies This is similar to what Prime Minister Narendra Modi is doing in India with the recent modification to the Forest Rights Act Both Brazil and India are expropriating the peoples rights over natural resources on a grand scale This is what capital and their ideologues call releasing the animal spirits of capital Capitalism not only has the Trumps Modis and Bolsonaros determine that what is good for capital is good for the people but also other ideologues One of them American economist William Nordhaus has built an economic model that essentially shows that it is better to spend money not on preventing climate change today but mitigating it in the future There are two fallacies in this approach One is that those producing climate changeeither directly through their emissions or by consuming products that produce carbon emissionsare going to be impacted far less than those who produce much lower carbon emissions Unfortunately the impact of such climate change is going to be far more adverse in tropical and equatorial regions of the world where the bulk of the poor live They also produce much less carbon emissions The other flaw in Nordhaustype models is that they privilege benefits received today over adverse effects in the future the same way a capitalist looks at his profits this quarters profits matter more than the longterm sustainability of capitalism itself Are other approaches and models possible Yes of course A number of approaches that address both these issues exist But climate science today has little to do with science it is politics and the interests of capital that are deciding our climate future Upton Sinclair the American writer had written in the 1930s It is difficult to get a man to understand something when his salary depends upon his not understanding it Denying global

    """The left has a thing for taking babies hostage. A perfect example of the “give us socialism or we’ll kill the kids” genre was recently published in The Guardian titled “The hardest decision of my life: to end a pregnancy because I had no paid leave.” This sort of story is irresistible to left-wing Christians such as Elizabeth Bruenig of The New York Times, whose tweet about the article is now deleted. It allows them to declare that the real way to end abortion is to make abortion unnecessary, and the only way to do that is by establishing a generous cradle-to-grave welfare state. This argument salves their consciences for their support of radically pro-abortion politicians like Sen. Bernie Sanders. It is also an extension of the dishonest taunt that conservative Christians only care about babies before they’re born. The Guardian article was designed to illustrate that argument, but on examination it demonstrates its failure. The author knew the child in her womb was a unique human life (“Looking at our wedding photos, I realized there were not just two lives present but three”), yet she chose an abortion anyway. Her ostensible reason is that, having just begun her job, she was not yet eligible for its paid leave policy, although management might have made an exception if she had asked (she thought about asking, but didn’t). She would certainly have been able to use sick days, if she had them, or ask for an unpaid leave of absence. This means she aborted her child because she was at risk of losing a few weeks’ pay. The author does not provide details, but it is revealing that she described her decision in terms of anxiety and planning preferences—“Was having the baby with extremely limited funds, in a small apartment, actually a romantic way to start a family?”—rather than directly stating that having the baby would be financially ruinous. She concludes her self-justification by declaring that “our situation did not embody the climate of confidence we agreed was necessary for us to be parents.” This shift from paid leave to a general “climate of confidence” gives the game away. If this was just about a few weeks of pay, it raises the question of whether there was some way for the author to raise that money in lieu of having her child killed. Notably, she does not report asking anyone for help. Her initial framing forces her to put a dollar amount on the life of her child, and confronts whether she could have done anything to ransom her baby. In contrast, demanding a “climate of confidence” makes her subjective sense of things a justification for what she did, regardless of the actual details of her case. This is not to say that her situation was not sympathetic. Having a baby is hard. Caring for a baby is hard. Going back to work after a few weeks, or even a few months, of leave is hard, made harder still if that leave has been at least partly unpaid. But a few weeks of salary is not worth killing your baby for. I am open to arguments that the United States should have more substantial pro-natalist policies, and conservatives have been promoting and debating various proposals that would add to existing policies such as the child tax credit and, yes, paid family leave, which President Trump promoted in his latest State of the Union address. But the left wants more than generous family leave policies, and will still champion abortion even if it gets its entire wish list. Looking around the world, there is never enough socialism for socialists to agree to abolish abortion. Looking around the United States, there is never enough welfare for the left to agree to end abortion—solidly Democratic states lead the nation in abortion rates. Even if the left gets everything else it wants, it will still insist on a right to kill developing humans in utero. In contrast, I and many others would happily compromise to end the legal killing of developing human persons in utero. Tax us more, cut the military, regulate businesses more, and expand the welfare state—we could tolerate America becoming more like 1970s Scandinavia if it meant that the left would agree let the babies live. But the left won’t, and the Guardian article shows why. Bearing and raising children requires sacrifices even in the most generous of welfare states. Rather than make those sacrifices, this mother sacrificed her child, and the left will defend her absolute right to do so even in their socialist utopia. Their vision of liberation from material necessity includes liberation not only from poverty, but also from the consequences of our sexual embodiment. Hence the unwavering socialist support for unrestricted legal abortion. Of course, many people refuse to admit the monstrous reality of the abortion regime that they and their political leaders support. Hence the pretense that some invisible hand of socialist plenty will end abortion, and the efforts to deflect blame for our nation’s abortion culture onto those who are working to abolish it. But it is just not so. It was not stingy family leave policies that had this baby killed, it was the child’s mother, encouraged and enabled by a culture and legal regime that regard babies as a capstone consumer commodity to be ordered up when convenient, and violently disposed of when inconvenient. She didn’t get an abortion because it was impossible for her to afford her baby; she got an abortion because she didn’t want her baby.""", 
    """Republicans should stop fighting amnesty, President Obama said on Thursday, because one day a Hispanic will become president. “Over the long term, this is going to get solved, because at some point there’s going to be a President Rodriguez or there’s going to be a President Chen,” Obama told a Florida International University town hall audience, hosted by Telemundo and MSNBC. “The country is a nation of immigrants, and ultimately it will reflect who we are and its politics are going to reflect who we are,” Obama continued, implying that neither native-born Americans or legal immigrants have moral standing to determine who enters and stays in the country. Hispanic foreigners attending the town hall — Fox News Latino did not say whether they were legal or illegal aliens — told Obama they feared that federal Judge Andrew Hansen’s stay on Obama’s executive order will force them to return to their home countries. (Fox News Latino incorrectly identifies Hansen as a Texas judge.) The five million illegal aliens covered by Obama’s executive order could also cash in on as much as $35,000 in taxpayer handouts. That’s a minimum $175 million cost to American taxpayers for the first year alone, not counting the massive strain the low-income, poorly-educated, gang-prone aliens with high rates of illegitimacy and untreated diseases will place on the country’s medical and social institutions. Obama’s claim that “history” was on his side is arguably false. The massive, historically unprecedented wave of immigrants crashing across the U.S. southern border is a political phenomenon, set in motion by the 1965 Immigration and Nationality Act and accelerated by the Obama administration’s disastrous Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA). The explosion of the Hispanic population has long-term job prospect consequences as well: Both legal and illegal aliens will occupy 75 percent of new American jobs in as little as five years. Each year, four million Americans seeking jobs turn 18. In 2012, almost six million Americans graduated from college, saddled with an average $27,000 in student loan debt — $8,000 less than the handouts available for illegals presently in the country.

        """From soccer games to marathons, concerns about coronavirus have led sports organizers to cancel or modify major events across the globe. With more than 80,000 reported cases of the disease, the viral outbreak continues to create uncertainty about future competitions, from track and field and Formula 1 to the ultimate global event, the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.
Last Sunday’s Tokyo Marathon, usually one of the largest in the world, went ahead with just 200 elite athletes and a request from organizers for spectators to stay home. The Hong Kong Marathon, scheduled for Feb. 9, was canceled; and the World Indoor Track and Field Championships, set for March 13-15 in Nanjing, China, have been postponed until next year.

For professional athletes whose bodies are their businesses, health is a top priority. As the epidemic spreads, more and more athletes are forced to weigh a potential threat against the financial loss of missing a competition.
“You’re going to get a lot of different answers,” said Chris Layne, managing director of Total Sports US, which represents some of the world’s top track and field athletes. “If you have an athlete at the pinnacle of their career, both in earnings and performance, maybe they can afford to miss an event versus someone fighting to get to that point.”
Track and field athletes don’t typically earn the lucrative salaries seen in the NBA, NFL, tennis or international soccer. The biggest shot for these athletes to make money lies in prizes and sponsorship deals. To earn either, you have to participate in events. That makes the impact of a missed event more significant, according to Layne.
“If you do six events and say you earn $500, that $3,000 lets you keep performing,” he said. “Track and field is really a global sport in terms of events so it could snowball with an athlete losing six, seven, eight times to compete and make a name for themselves. You could be taking away a season’s worth of earning potential.”
One of the bigger sponsorship opportunities for track and field athletes lies in the Olympics, which provide nearly unparalleled exposure. But if coronavirus continues to be a threat, the decision about whether to risk competing could be out of athletes’ hands.
Dick Pound, a senior member of the International Olympic Committee, said a decision about whether to proceed with holding the event would need to be made by late May. If the coronavirus isn’t contained by that point, Pound said cancellation could be a possibility.
For now, the IOC isn’t planning to cancel the Games, which have dealt with potential health threats in the recent past. There were concerns about bird flu ahead of the 2018 Pyeongchang Olympics, Zika during the 2016 Rio Olympics, and swine flu before the 2010 Vancouver Olympics.""",
    
    """More in-person voting sites in metro areas. Better information about where polls have been relocated. More public education about how to vote from home and what to do if an absentee ballot doesn’t arrive—or arrives at the last minute. And no last-minute government decisions that confuse voters and undermine voting, such as imposing curfews before the polls close.
These are some of the takeaways from the nine presidential primaries that took place on June 2, the largest day of voting across America since the pandemic broke in mid-March, where most of the states and the District of Columbia responded by shifting to voting with mailed-out ballots rather than voting centered on local polling places as in previous elections.
The approaches taken in these states and districts varied and reflected the trends seen across the United States. Montana and Maryland mailed ballots to voters. Washington, D.C., and four states sent voters applications to get a mail-in ballot. Pennsylvania and Indiana left it up to voters to apply for an absentee ballot, get the ballots on time, and submit it on time to be counted.
The results were a spectrum of well-run to more-problematic elections. Montana, which is used to voting by mail, had higher turnout than its 2018 fall midterm. But many voters who were not used to voting from home, especially in metro areas, did not get ballots as expected. They went to vote in person, but often found traditional polling places closed. They ended up in long lines and sometimes faced hours-long waits, where social distancing could be challenging, and, in the worst case—in Washington—police were telling voters to go home because of a curfew.
These trends, both better and worse, offer lessons and warning signs for the fall’s elections.
“Overall, this is a dry run for November,” said Kristen Clarke, president and executive director of the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, which runs the nation’s largest Election Day hotline and fielded more than 5,000 calls for the primaries. “We’re bracing for high turnout that we will see in the November general election, and lessons learned from this primary season must guide states… to ensure that every eligible voter can have their voice heard.”
“It is clear that the pandemic is having an impact on virtually every aspect of the voting experience,” she said, noting that impact was apart from a curfew in Washington that was announced by a text alert on Election Day that “did not have an exception making it clear that voters can, indeed, continue to travel to cast their ballot.”
Voting in quasi-militarized settings was not confined to the nation’s capital. In Philadelphia, on election eve, the mayor announced a curfew that was slated to take effect an hour before its polls closed, but subsequently delayed it after an outcry by other city officials and activists. The curfews, which have never before occurred on an Election Day in recent times, were a response to looting that occurred after generally peaceful protests against police violence and racism. However, the curfews also come in a climate where the Republican Party, led by President Trump, has been repeatedly making false claims that voting by mail is rife with fraud.
“This is simply not true,” wrote the National Vote at Home Institute’s Amber McReynolds and MIT’s Charles Stewart III, both experts, for the Hill. They noted that the right-wing Heritage Foundation’s oft-cited election fraud database listed 204 cases and 143 convictions using mailed ballots in the past 20 years, where “about 250 million votes have been cast by a mail ballot.” That activity level is “about five times less likely than getting hit by lightning in the United States.”
But while partisan propaganda about voting by mail is only likely to increase as the general election nears, the nuts-and-bolts challenges of shifting to voting by mail in states that have not widely instituted that process is very much a work in progress. In that sense, the statewide and district primaries on June 2, as well as dozens of elections that will be held now through the summer, are microcosms of what is working and what needs to be fixed for the fall.
A Spectrum of States
The June 2 primaries featured jurisdictions with more and less experience running mail-based elections. On the most experienced side, Montana, where the senior statewide election official is a Republican, continued its practice of mailing all voters a ballot. More people voted for its 2020 primary than during the state’s November 2018 midterms.
“Sixty-three percent of active registered voters,” said Phil Keisling, the National Vote at Home Institute’s board chair and former Oregon secretary of state. “That’s higher than 41 states in their midterms in 2018. That’s the power of mailing everyone a ballot.”
While Montana was an example of how voter turnout will increase in states where voters have become used to voting from home, the experience in Midwestern and Eastern states that have not embraced voting from home until the pandemic was rockier was a different story—and not just because of the pandemic’s social distancing requirements or police presence due to widespread protests.
In Pennsylvania’s largest cities, Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, in Washington, D.C., in Baltimore, Maryland, and in Indianapolis, Indiana, election officials underestimated the number of people who sought to vote in person for any number of reasons: from not getting a mail-in ballot; to getting a ballot late and wanting to drop it off; to simply wanting to vote in a polling place.
While Pennsylvania’s top officials reported a “smooth election amid historic circumstances” as 1.8 million residents applied for an absentee ballot, “17 times greater than the number who applied” in its 2016 presidential primary, voting rights advocates manning election-protection hotlines observed a different experience. The Lawyers’ Committee said that 55 percent of the calls received on June 2 were from Pennsylvania—and from people unable to vote by mail.
Half of the hotline calls concerned finding a polling place, the Committee’s Lacy Crawford said. Another 17 percent concerned ballots—meaning unfamiliarity with mailed-out ballots versus polling place voting. Another 13 percent concerned voter registration. Of slightly less than half of the callers who reported their race, 63 percent were Black, 21 percent were white and 12 percent were Latino.
The takeaway from the committee briefings, where its partners summarized what they were hearing from hundreds of observers, underscored that accommodating the fall’s voters will mean planning for high levels of voting from home—but still significant in-person voting at precincts. That conclusion is what emerges after hearing detailed reports of snafus.
“The big theme of the day is confusion,” said Ivan Garcia, civic engagement director for MakeTheRoadPA.org. “Voters are turning up to their old polling place and not always finding directions to the consolidated poll place that they should be going to. Because of the pandemic, you had last-minute changes, and it confused a lot of voters.”"""
