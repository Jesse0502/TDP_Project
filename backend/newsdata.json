The chemical compounds behind drug molecules must be shaped to fit with the proteins in our bodies to produce therapeutic effects. That requirement for a meticulous fit means the creation of new drugs is extremely complex and time-consuming.\nTo speed up the puzzle-fitting process, researchers at SMU have created SmartCADD. This open-source virtual tool combines artificial intelligence, quantum mechanics and Computer Assisted Drug Design (CADD) techniques to speed up the screening of chemical compounds, significantly reducing drug discovery timelines.

    "content": " A new study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS) challenges long-held assumptions about human cooperation. Traditionally, behavioral scientists and economists have primarily studied cooperation in public good contexts through repeated interactions, where individuals can build trust and reciprocal relationships, adjusting their behavior based on the actions of others. However, many real-world, naturally occurring situations, such as volunteering or donating to crisis relief efforts, are one-time decisions with no obvious future interactions or relationships to consider. This new study, co-authored by Dr. Natalie Struwe and Prof. Esther Blanco from the University of Innsbruck with Prof. James [...]",

The technique opens the door to engineering materials tailored for use in next-generation printed LEDs and lasers -- and holds promise for engineering other materials for use in photovoltaic devices.\nPerovskites, which are defined by their crystalline structure, have desirable optical, electronic and quantum properties. LHPs consist of incredibly thin sheets of perovskite semiconductor material that are separated from each other by thin organic [...]",
